Developing Semester.ly on Docker

Steps are below on getting your local development environment running:
* Clone this repository
* Create semesterly/local_settings.py as follows:
DEBUG = True

TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'postgres', 
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': 'db',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
* Edit semesterly/dev_credentials.py and add a value for JHU_API_KEY in single quotes like below. You can get this from sis.jhu.edu/api
'JHU_API_KEY': 'xxxxxxxx',
* add entry to your hosts file as follows (This file is in c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hosts)
127.0.0.1       sem.ly jhu.sem.ly


Build and run your container (first time takes longer as it has to download, subsequent runs are pretty quick)
* docker-compose build
* docker-compose up
You now have semesterly running. If this is the first time, you will want some data.

Getting JHU data for a given term
* In a new terminal run the following
docker ps 
(this will list all running containers, grab the name of your container, it will look like: semesterly_web_1_972d650bb19d you will use this in the following 2 commands)
docker exec -it name_of_container python manage.py ingest jhu --term Spring --years 2018
docker exec -it name_of_container python manage.py digest jhu
* Open a browser and visit http://jhu.sem.ly:8000 and you should be good to go
